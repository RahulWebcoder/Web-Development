                                Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, decided to move the capital of the empire from Agra to
                                Delhi.

                                a must. Erotica thrives here with over 20 temples devoted to sexuality and sex. The
                                temples are best known for their erotic sculptures. But more than anything they are a
